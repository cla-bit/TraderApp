Trader App - Interview Project

<h1>Sample Project</h1>:
<b>Dynamic User and Admin Dashboard App</b>

Background:
Our startup has given 10 stock traders $100 each to trade. We want a dashboard where each trader can track their profit or loss overtime (data point at 1 minute interval). We also want an admin dashboard where the manager can track the performance of the 10 traders.

New users are given $100 as capital.

1. Users can create an account or Login to their accounts.
2. Administrators can login and check, and manage users activities.
3. With a scheduling job, a simulation of profit and loss is done every minute.
